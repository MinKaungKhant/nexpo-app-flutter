# Arkad Flutter Application

This is the arkad application rewritten using the flutter framework.

## Installation
* Start by installing Flutter. Information regarding the installation of Flutter can be found at flutter.dev. When installing flutter there will be steps to install the other requirements(Android studio and x-code for instance). Make sure to follow those steps.
* When everything seems to be installed make sure to run `flutter doctor` to make sure everything works as intended.
* To make sure the development environment isn't causing trouble we use Visual Studio Code with the Flutter extension. To minimize issues it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code with the Flutter extension. 
* After the installation of flutter you should clone this repository to start working on the application.
* However, before being able to run the app properly, the dependencies must be installed. The enabled dependencies is defined in the pubspec.yaml file. To install the dependencies you navigate to the local repository and run `flutter pub get`. 

## Running the app on an android emulator
* Open up android studio and launch an android emulator.
* Navigate to the project directory with a terminal window.
* run `flutter run` and the app will run on the emulator.

## Running the app on an iOS simulator
* Run an iOS simulator device.
* Navigate to the project directory with a terminal window.
* run `flutter run` and the app will run on the simulator.

## Running the app on a physical device
* Plug your device in to your machine.
* Navigate to the project directory with a terminal window.
* run `flutter run` and the app win run on the physical device. 

## Getting started with flutter
In order to get going with flutter as easy as possible we've come up with a list of material that might be useful for that!
* Test write an application with [this guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
* Look through some [sample projects](https://flutter.github.io/samples/#)
* The [flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) is very useful, so use it!
* Consistent naming of files, classes and everything else is very important for readability and understandning of the code. Make sure to [read this guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) before proceeding with development of this application.
